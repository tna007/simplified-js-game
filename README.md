# simplified-js-game

This is a small group project at BC Helsinki using Vanilla JS and pure CSS to create a simplified turn-base game with features as below:

* 2 action buttons represent a normal attack and an ultra attack.
* Fetch random opponent from own JSON.
* Text box to show all the log of actions that user(s) have interacted (clicked) the buttons
